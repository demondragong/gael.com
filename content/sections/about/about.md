My name is GaÃ«l. I'm a former product manager who was eager to create things. So I learned to code.

As a web developer, I love to experiment with different technologies. I've got solid front-end development foundations â€”that means HTML, CSS and JavaScript if you're no too tech-savvyâ€” but I've also played a lot with frameworks and libraries such as Django, React and its ecosystem. 

As a former product manager, I know when not to reinvent the wheel. This website is an example of what that means. It was built on top of a fantastic Gatsby theme created by <a href="https://konstantin.digital" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>konstantin.digital</u></a>.

Can I build something like that? I can.

Could I have designed it? Maybe not. Then again, I'm not a designer ðŸ¤·
